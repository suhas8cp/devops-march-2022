Terraform 
	- Terraform is an open source tool from HashiCorp company used to 
	  write Insfrastructure as A Code (IaC) to automate provisioning the public cloud insfrasructure.
  	
	- Terraform is written in Golang and available on GitHub 
	
	- Terraform code/configuration is written in HCL (HashiCorp Language) of type .tf
	
	- Terraform helps in prediction of changes through plans and we can know what changes 
	  will be applied before applying it.

	- Terraform always keeps the infrastructure state saved and terraform at every apply 
	  of the changes to insfrasructure is always matched with the state file and it predicts the changes 
	  need to be applied.
	  
	- Safe to run terraform code many times because terraform only apply the changes for 
	  the first if the chagnes are not there in state.

	- Terraform scripts can be version contralled means we keep the terraform 
	  scripts in github.
	  
Terraform Provider 
	- providers are the API to interact with public clouds in our company, aws is the 
	  provider that we are using.
	- In a complete terraform project we can have only one provider block.
		
			provider "aws" {
				access_key = ""
				secret_key = ""
				region = ""
			}
		
	- If we wont configure access_key and secret_key key in provider block then terraform 
	  will try to fetch the keys from aws_cli that is using the below environment variables.
			1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
			2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
			
	How to use multiple configurations with same provider block ?
	How to use a provider with multiple region ? 
		
	provider aliases
		- we can define multiple configuration for the same provider and select which provider
		  to use in resource and other blocks.
		
		provider "aws" {
			region = "ap-south-1"
		}
		
		provider "aws" {
			alias = "region1"
			region = "us-east-1"
		}

		provider "aws" {
			alias = "region2"
			region = "us-east-2"
		}		
		
		How to use provider alias ?
			resource "<resource_type>" "<resource_name>" {
				provider = aws.region1
			}
			
			resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
				provider = aws.region2
				ami = ""
				instance_type = "t2.micro"
			}
			
Terraform Registry 
	- Terraform registry is a repository of modules and resources which are wrrite by trerraform 
	  w.r.t public clouds and we user this resources for provisioning	public clouds.
	- Terraform regisrty is also a community based registry which are maintained by providers only.
	
		URL: regisrty.terraform.io
		
	Example: aws - ec2 instance -> aws_instance
				 - s3 bucket    -> aws_s3_bucket 
				 - vpc 		    -> aws_vpc	
				 
Assignment: List all the resource types of aws provider which you know in aws ? 

Terraform init 
	- This command we use to insitialize a working directory containing terraform script as 
	  terraform project. 
	- This in the first command that should be executed after writing a new terraform script.
    - It is safe to run this command multiple times. 
			
		The insitializations steps are: 
			1. Initializing the Backend ....
			2. Initializing provider plugins ...
			3. Initializing the child modules ...
			
terraform plan 
	- the terraform plan is used to create a execution plan which internally performs a refresh 
	  unless user has disabled this refresh.
	- Plan will scan all the .tf scripts in the project directory and it manages to determine 
	  the changes to be applied to cloud (means it determines the desired state).
	- Plan will never do any changes to the actual insfrasructure it just gives what desired 
	  state will be applied.
	
	To save a plan in a file 
		terraform plan -out <file_name>	
		terraform plan -out plan.out	

terraform apply 
	- The terraform apply command is used to apply the planned changes to the actual cloud 
	  insfrasructure. 
	- This will internally run the plan again then with the user confirmation the predicted 
	  changes will be applied.
		
	To apply changes will out user confirmation 
		terraform apply --auto-approve
	
	To run a perticular terraform script
		terraform apply <script>.tf <script1>.tf
		
	To apply a plan file
		terraform apply <plan_file>
			
tarrafotm destroy 
	- This is used to destroy the resources which are manged by this current terraform 
	  scripts.
    - Crate a destroy plan

		TO destroy one resource
			terraform destroy -target <resource_type>.<resource_name>
			example: terraform destroy -target aws_instance.ec2_ubuntu

terraform validate 
	- This is to validate the syntax of the terraform scripts in a project.		
		
Terraform state 
	- When ever we build an insfrastructure with terraform configuration files (terraform apply) 
	  a file gets generates by name terraform.tfstate which contains the all the configuration data in JSON format.
	- When we try to apply / rerun the apply command, terraform will compare the actual state of cloud with the 
	  state file and generates the plan.
	  
	Types of state in terraform 
		- local 
			we can keep the state file locally in the same machince where we execute the terraform code.
		
		- Remote 
			also know as backend, Instead of keeping state file in local we can keep it in a remote location 
			such as s3, etcd, kuberntes, artifactory etc.
			
			Benifits
			  - Safer storage: As state file contains sensitive data, Saving in the remote place we can safe quard the data 
							   example: in s3 backed we can use encrypted s3 to secure the state file.
			  - Versioning/Auditing: Invalid access can be identified or can maintain the version on state file.
			  - Multiple user of same team can apply the changes by sharing the same state file.
			
terraform settings 
	- used for specifying provider requirements 
	- we can restrict the provider version 
	- we configure backend in this settings 
	- we use terraform block 
	- default file terraform.tf / versions.tf 	
		
		terraform {
			
		}
		
terraform variables and outputs 
	- Local variables
		A local valuse assigned to a name, so we can use it multiple times with in the same module 
		without repeating it.
		
			locals {
				service_name = "gmail"
				owner = "Kubernetes"
			}
		
	- input variables
		Input variable serve as parameters for terraform configuration files/modules 
		main advantage is input variables are used to configure the modules instead of altering the source code 
		we can pass the input values.
		To supress the values in the console output use sensitive = true 
			
			variable "bucket_name" {
				type = string
				sensitive = true
				default = "s3-backend-bucket-aaaaa-22222"
			}
		 
	- output variables 
		- output variable are like return values of terraform code.
		- A child module can use the output of anotehr module as input.
		- To supress the values in the console output use sensitive = true

			output "ec2_public_ip" {
				value = aws_instance.new_ec2.public_ip 
			}
